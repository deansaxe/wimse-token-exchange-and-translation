OpenID Connect [ID Token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken), and\r\n2. JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens ([RFC 9068](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9068.html))\r\n2. CWTs, https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8392.html#section-3.1.3\r\n\r\nthis is a countermeasure against both misuse, and replay attacks, especially in cases, when an AS in one security domain exchanges one of these tokens from another (security) domain. I tend to think that OpenID Connect ID Token isn't a very good candidate to be exchanged for something else, it's impossible to deny this use cases is an extremely popular one in the wild... However, it's a mechanism to pass claims about the authentication of user to an RP and they don't necessary include all information about a user (the subject could be opaque, etc.) to issue an AT for it. Furthermore, ID Token could be easily encrypted by an OP and decrypted only by an RP using its public keys. Interestingly enough, the OpenID Connect spec, allows ID Tokens to be unsigned in certain cases. Lastly, the OpenID Core specification doesn't define a dedicated value for the typ claim for its ID Tokens, that makes it hard to distinguish them from other JWTs. \r\n\r\nPlease also remember that OpenID Connect ID Token, as well as other above mentioned ATs can be passed around using the front channel.\r\n\r\nThe spec should be specific about allowed exchange types for SAML assertions (only assertions from SAML IDPs need to be allowed).",

A refresh token can be issued in cases where the client of the token exchange needs the ability to access a resource even when the original credential is no longer valid (e.g., user-not-present or offline scenarios where there is no longer any user entertaining an active session with the client). Profiles or deployments of this specification should clearly document the conditions under which a client should expect a refresh token in response to urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange grant type requests.",
